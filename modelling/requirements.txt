Board
- Imagine a group of people leading a company or an association.
- This group of people is organised in a board.
- The board consists of:
    - 1 chairperson
    - [x] board members
    - 1 secretary
- The board comes together to debate topics and take decisions.

Decisions
- Decisions are taken per topics in a yes or no vote.
- A topic is either accepted or rejected.

Topics
- Topics to vote on are presented by the secretary one after the other, followed by a vote on the topic.
- Assume that any topic description consisting of a non-empty text is valid. This means, a single character already fulfils the requirement.

Voting
- All board members are eligible to vote.
- The chairperson does not vote (exception: tie break, see below).
- The secretary is not eligible to vote.
--- Every person eligible to vote is allowed to vote once per topic.
- In every vote, the possible answers are: yay, nay, blank.
- The chairperson decides when to end the vote and start the count.
- In case of a tie (same amount of yay and nay votes), the chairperson takes the final decision to break the tie.
- In order to break the tie, the chairperson must vote with either yay or nay.
- The chairperson communicates the result.

Documentation
- The final result is documented for each topic as follows:
    - topic description
    - yay, no, blank
    - tie-break (if applicable)
    - decision



- The chairperson decides when to end the vote and start the count. => You sure?
- Change votes?
- People vote twice?
